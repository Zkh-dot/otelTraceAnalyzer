# Installation

lib is builded for linux only, if you make a windows build please make a pr, i'll be happy to add it

basically lib should be accessible via pip [here](https://pypi.org/project/otelanalyzer/), but if you can't install pacages on your env freely here is a solution 4u

in embedder.py is a script, that will create python scritp, dumping so binary file in your desired location, so you could import all functions from it. there will be no syntax highlighting, but you could use lib without installing it through pip.

u could simply use analyzer from this folder, if you dont wanna re-compile lib and you trust that there is no secret miner from me in it =D
